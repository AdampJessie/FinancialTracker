# Project Title

## Description of the Project

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what  problems it aims to solve.

This Java console application acts as a financial tracker. The intended user is any individual who wishes to organize their finances! The purpose is to take a file containing an unorganized list of deposits and payments
and deliver sorted information in a user-friendly readable way. The user has the ability to view all transactions, view only deposits or payments, and filter by date or vendor.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of this application. Formatted as: "As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason]."

- As an individual, I would like an intuitive menu selection screen so that I always know what my available options are.
- As an individual, I would like to read information from a file containing my financial information so that I can quickly consolidate and organize prerecorded information.
- As an individual, I would like to record my deposits and payments and save it to a file so that I can keep a comprehensive record of my losses and gains.
- As an individual, I would like to view a ledger that allows filtering so that I may fully organize my finances without any hassle.
- As an individual, I would like to run tailored reports that allow for custom searches (Month to Date, Previous Month, etc) so that I may quickly access relevant information.
